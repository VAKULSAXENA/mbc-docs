# Yes Coin: Ethereum â†” Yes Coin

Yes Coin native bridge between Ethereum and Yes Coin is used to relay the Yes Coin native token from Yes Coin to Ethereum network

## Architecture Overview

The Yes Coin bridged is based on POA's bridge implementation, it is used to transfer Yes Coin tokens between the Yes Coin chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's Yes Coin or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender. The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of Yes Coin tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events of relaying the block rewards to the Ethereum network:

**Mint block reward distributed on the Yes Coin chain on Ethereum**

Each cycle the total block reward distributed on Yes Coin chain is minted on Ethereum and locked on the bridge contract.

This works by listening to the \`RewardedOnCycle\` event emitted by the BlockReward contract on Yes Coin chain, waiting for all bridge validators on Yes Coin chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to mint on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

## Contracts

Home side of the bridge on the Yes Coin network: [0xd617774b9708F79187Dc7F03D3Bdce0a623F6988](https://yesscan.io/address/0xd617774b9708F79187Dc7F03D3Bdce0a623F6988/transactions)

Foreign side of the bridge on the Ethereum network: [0x07C53925485179505e1189021c8f794A2A16da54](https://yesscan.io/address/0x07C53925485179505e1189021c8f794A2A16da54/transactions)

## How to use

On Yes Coin you send native Yes Coin token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the Yes Coin token on the Ethereum network, sent from the foreign bridge contract

On Ethereum network you transfer the Yes Coin token to the foreign bridge contract. After a couple of confirmations, you will receive equal amount of the Yes Coin native token, sent from the home bridge contract.
