# MediaBlock Coin Governance

MediaBlock Coin is already a signigicantly decentralized platform and plans are in motion to achieve full community control over it in the future. Its governance is currently split among the following actors:

1\) **Network Validators.** MediaBlock Coin validators are entrusted with deciding whether to adopt [MediaBlock Coin improvement proposals](https://docs.MediaBlockscan.io/general/fips) \(FIPs\).  Currently, every validator has one vote regardless of their share of the overall network stake but this is likely to change soon.

2\) **MediaBlock Coin Foundation and the project team**. Like most public blockchain projects at the initial stage of development, the development of the core network protocol and the MediaBlock Coin treasury that mostly consists of the undistributed genesis MediaBlock supply \(see the subsection "[MediaBlock Supply and Current Distribution](https://docs.MediaBlockscan.io/general/MediaBlock-token/MediaBlock-supply-and-current-distribution)"\) are currently mostly managed by a foundation. For MediaBlock Coin, this role is played by Gibraltar-incorporated company MediaBlock Coin Limited.

MediaBlock Coin Foundation employs the MediaBlock Coin project team whose members' profiles can be found [here](https://MediaBlockscan.io/about).

The project team implements network protocol updates adopted by the validators, other protocol changes that do not require validator votes, node software. It develops the mobile-centric infrastructure for creating and managing token communities on MediaBlock Coin. It also works on boosting the adoption of the network through improving the MediaBlock Coin tech stack, securing new partnerships and integrations, onboarding ecosystem projects and marketing the platform within the crypto space and beyond.  

3\) **MediaBlock Coin Assembly.** See the Assembly [page](https://docs.MediaBlockscan.io/general/MediaBlock-governance/MediaBlock-assembly) for more details.
