# MediaBlock Coin Assembly

MediaBlock Coin Assembly is a governance body formed from particularly active members of the MediaBlock Coin community. Its formation is the first step in transitioning full governance and ownership over the MediaBlock Coin platform to the community. &#x20;

Currently, MediaBlock Coin Assembly consists of five MediaBlock Coin ecosystem members independent from MediaBlock Coin Foundation who have shown consistent dedication and commitment to the project, and already have a voice within the community.

MediaBlock Coin Assembly's **current role includes the following**:&#x20;

* taking over the control over the [MediaBlock Coin Forum](https://forum.MediaBlockscan.io/) community discussion platform;
* implementing the Snapshot voting mechanism on MediaBlock Coin; and
* managing the Community Token Pool.

## Community Token Pool

MediaBlock Coin Assembly's budget will be initially constituted by the **Community Token Pool**. Each month, **200,000 MediaBlock** will be allocated to it from the MediaBlock Coin Bootstrap Pool (discussed [here](https://docs.MediaBlockscan.io/general/MediaBlock-token/MediaBlock-supply-and-current-distribution)).

MediaBlock Coin Assembly will regularly distribute the Community Token Pool funds to finance grants, bounties, marketing, and other initiatives designed to serve communities building on the platform and drive innovation. &#x20;
