# MediaBlock Coin Token (MediaBlock)

The MediaBlock token is the native currency of the MediaBlock Coin blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## MediaBlock utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the MediaBlock Coin blockchain, MediaBlock is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake MediaBlock Coin to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.MediaBlockscan.io/](https://status.MediaBlockscan.io/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked MediaBlock. Which means validators with higher amounts of MediaBlock Coin staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any MediaBlock holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of MediaBlock they wish. They receive a share of the MediaBlock Coin block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As MediaBlock is the native currency on MediaBlock Coin, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, MediaBlock transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of MediaBlock tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the MediaBlock Coin platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
