# Yes Coin Token (YES)

The YES token is the native currency of the Yes Coin blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## YES utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Yes Coin blockchain, YES is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Yes Coin to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.yesscan.io/](https://status.yesscan.io/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked YES. Which means validators with higher amounts of Yes Coin staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any YES holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of YES they wish. They receive a share of the Yes Coin block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As YES is the native currency on Yes Coin, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, YES transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of YES tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Yes Coin platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
