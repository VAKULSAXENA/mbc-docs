# Network Overview and Key Metrics

MediaBlock Coin is the decentralized public blockchain that powers the MediaBlock Coin ecosystem. It is fully compatible with Ethereum meaning that any smart contract that can be deployed on the latter can also run on top of MediaBlock Coin.

The MediaBlock Coin blockchain uses a variant of delegated Proof of Stake \(dPoS\) for achieving consensus. The consensus is currently secured by 39 validators, only one of which is run by the MediaBlock Coin core team.

The blockchain is designed to ensure fast block confirmation times and a low cost of transactions. The average block interval on MediaBlock Coin is currently around 5 seconds, and it costs much less than $0.01 to get a transaction confirmed.
